Version: 0.5.0

Description: Creates a HTML widget which displays the results of searching
    for a pattern in files in a given folder. The results can be viewed in 
    the 'RStudio' viewer pane, included in a 'R Markdown' document or in a 
    'Shiny' application. Also provides a 'Shiny' application allowing to run 
    this widget and to navigate in the files found by the search. Instead of
    creating a HTML widget, it is also possible to get the results of the 
    search in a 'tibble'. The search is performed by the 'grep' command-line 
    utility.
